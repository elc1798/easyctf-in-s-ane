We first extract the JPEG which leaves us with a folder aptly named "not
suspicious". Inside this folder, we have 25 files named "[number].short.out"
filled with garbage text and a file named "WhatAFineKeyThisIs.short.out" which
contains the text "my favorite numbers are seven and three." and the ciphertext
"gaf cnrvp qnjkfs hz zfufqgffq".  Running the ciphertext through a
cryptogram/substitution cipher solver (http://www.quipqiup.com/index.php) which
uses frequency analysis, we get a possible plaintext of "the lucky number is
seventeen".  This clues us in to 17.short.out, which we can scan through for any
plaintext.  As I was reading through it, my eye caught upon "EFF0RTS" and the
entire text block it was in was "ANSWER4Y0UREFF0RTSISC1PH3RSANDKRYPT0", giving
us the flag which is C1PH3RSANDKRYPT0. It seems as if the other plaintext in
WhatAFineKeyThisIs.short.out was merely a distraction.
