This is a poem code encryption.
===============================================================================
We are given 5 numbers, which refer to words in the poem that are used to form
the transposition key for the cipher.
The five words are while, weary, while, there, and bleak.
To get the transposition key, we number the letters in whilewearywhiletherebleak
alphabetically (a -> 1, a -> 2, b -> 3, ...) which gives us 25 numbers
If we split our ciphertext into columns of 25 characters, we get exactly 4 rows.
Therefore, each block of the ciphertext represents one vertical column.
We then traverse in parallel through our ciphertext (by each block of 4 chars)
and our transposition key and assign a column number based on the transposition
key at that index.
For example, 'w' in "while" is numbered 22, so the first block "uuoy" is
assigned to column 22.
We continue this until we have all the columns assigned.
Now, we can simple read the columns right to left to get our plaintext message.

    Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore –
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door –
    "'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber door –
    Only this and nothing more."

    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
    And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wished the morrow; – vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrow – sorrow for the lost Lenore – 
    For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore – 
    Nameless here for evermore.'"
