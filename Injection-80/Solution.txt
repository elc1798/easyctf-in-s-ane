This problem is basic sql injection, very similar to Injection-1 of PicoCTF

The way to do this is to enter an executable query that would replace the normal search database verification system.

The username entered should be:
' OR 1 = 1 LIMIT 1 -- 

This would comment out the rest of the password verification code, and just use 1 = 1, which is true, to give you the info.

You type that in, you get the user as admin, and the message as "there might be another user"

So you change the query to:
' OR 1 = 1 LIMIT 2 -- 

This gives you the flag, which is "kids_dont_code_like_this_at_home"
